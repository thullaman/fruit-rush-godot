# Fruit Rush

Fruit Rush is a 2D parkour-based platformer built using the Godot Engine. The project focuses on movement, level flow, collectibles, and experimentation with multiple ways to complete a level.

## Gameplay Overview
The game starts on a main menu screen where the player can select Level 1 or Level 2. Each level is designed around parkour-style movement with platforms, jumps, and obstacles.

Players collect melons during gameplay, which are counted as a score and displayed on the top-left of the screen. The levels are fully playable from start to finish.

Both levels include hidden easter-egg paths that make the level easier to complete if discovered, encouraging exploration and rewarding curious players.

Reaching the trophy at the end of Level 1 transitions the player to Level 2. Completing Level 2 returns the player back to the main menu.

## Features
- Parkour-based platforming gameplay
- Two playable levels with different layouts
- Melon collecting with score counter
- Hidden shortcut paths for easier completion
- Level transitions using trophy-based endpoints
- Main menu with level selection

## Current Development Status
The game is **playable and complete in terms of core gameplay**, but it is still under development.

I am currently working on:
- Adding enemy characters (mushroom-based enemies)
- Expanding challenge and interaction within levels
- Improving level balance and difficulty progression

## What I Learned
This project helped me understand:
- Designing parkour-focused movement systems
- Creating levels with multiple solution paths
- Managing scoring and collectibles
- Structuring game flow between menus and levels
- Iterating on a game while keeping it playable at all stages

## Tools & Tech
- Engine: Godot
- Language: GDScript
- Genre: 2D Platformer / Parkour

## Status
Playable prototype (actively improving)
